-----------  Kohana Fizzle  -----------
	It's a forum to tha izzle, sucka.

--

	Kohana fizzle, or maybe kfizzle, is a proof-of-concept
	forum for the kohana php framework.

--
	
	DEMO: http://demo.plusjade.com/forum

--	
	
	 Highlights:
	 
	 -- Plug and Play Kohana Module.
	 -- Users can vote up/down posts and comments.
	 -- Sort by newest, active, and votes.
	 -- Nearly 100% ajaxable but maintains 100% degradability.
	 -- Nearly 100% unobtrusive.
	 -- Super Concise. Just look at that nice forum class.
	 
--
	 
	 Philosophy:
		 Forums are about data first. Give users efficient
		 tools to handle data - everything else is secondary.
	 
--
	 
	 Goals:
		-- Focus on the data/content.
		-- Stay modern, without bloat - (I'm looking at you phpbb).

--

	CAUTION: 
	
	As of 12/21/09 this is a non-complete prototype only.
	The intention is to get it out and get some feedback.
	I shall keep you updated!
